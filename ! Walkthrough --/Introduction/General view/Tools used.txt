For this Data Base project the tools that I will use are:

CSV files - Here is where all the raw data is stored.

Microsoft SQL Server - Here is where I will build the database and write the Queries

GitHub - Where I will document and report everything

Draw.io - This is the program that I will use for the data models, visuals and diagrams.

Notion - Used for the mapping of this process of build. (A CHECKLIST)
