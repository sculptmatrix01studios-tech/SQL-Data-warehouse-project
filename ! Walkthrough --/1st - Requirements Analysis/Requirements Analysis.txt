🚀 Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple operational systems, enabling reliable analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

Specifications

Data Sources

Import data from two operational systems: CRM and ERP

Source data is provided as CSV files

Data is ingested without modification in the initial (Bronze) layer to preserve traceability

Data Quality

Clean and standardize data before analytical consumption

Handle common data quality issues such as duplicates, invalid values, and inconsistent formats

Apply validation rules at each transformation layer

Integration

Combine CRM and ERP data into a single analytical model

Use clear data modeling principles to support joins, aggregations, and reporting use cases

Scope

Focus on the latest available data only

Historical tracking and slowly changing dimensions are out of scope for this project

Documentation

Provide clear documentation of:

Data flow and lineage

Layer responsibilities (Bronze, Silver, Gold)

Modeling decisions and transformations

Documentation is designed to support both business users and analytics teams, while also serving as proof of learning and understanding




BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior

Product Performance

Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
