**What is Data Warehousing?**

A.: Based on the father of the data warehouse William H. Inmon:



A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process.





***Breakdown***:



\- Subject-oriented means it's business area focused, Like the sales, customers, finances and so on.



\- Integrated because it get all the source systems and works with it, meaning that it is used for more than one source.



\- Time-variant it means you can keep historical data inside the data warehouse.



\- Non-volatile means once the data enter the data warehouse it is not deleted or modified. (in short data doesn't change by itself).





***Purpose***:

Using Data warehouse we can make the Collecting, Analyze, Share \& Report really easy and consistent from a one true stand of point (the Data Warehouse) which helps saving time.



Example: One Person collects one's own data, cleans by oneself and than has to do the analyze process share \& report, and the others do the same from a completely different data source point(Because the data may vary due to difference in the date the context here is the data from one company without Data Warehouse)



This process can take weeks and also give some inaccurate and not coherent results, leading to bad management and waste of time for a simple analyze.



And here is where Data Warehousing comes into the picture because through the Processes of ETL (Extract Transform and Load) we can get the different source data (Integration) into a single true stand point suitable for the company use.



True stand point means:

 		- Same time span/status (1 day old data update for example) for every user

 		- History of the data

 		- It handles Big Data (Unlike simple Excel spreadsheets).



The best part is that the whole process becomes fully automated and way faster, from weeks to hours or minutes, we are talking about a save of time which is something that every company needs.
