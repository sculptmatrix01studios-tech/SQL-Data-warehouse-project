Details — Requirements & Data Management Approach
1. Requirements Analysis
1.1 Business Context

The goal of this project is to design and implement a Data Warehouse (DWH) that consolidates data coming from multiple operational systems (CRM and ERP) into a centralized analytical platform.

The Data Warehouse must support:

Business reporting

Ad-hoc analytical queries

Future analytical use cases such as Machine Learning

The focus is analytics, not operational workloads.

1.2 Source Systems

The data originates from two main systems:

CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

Customer information

Product information

Sales transactions

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

Customer master data

Product categories

Location data

Source characteristics:

Data is provided as CSV files

Files are dropped into folders

No transformations are applied at the source level

Data quality issues are expected (duplicates, invalid dates, overlaps, etc.)

1.3 Functional Requirements

The Data Warehouse must:

Store raw data without modification for traceability

Clean and standardize data before it is consumed

Apply business rules consistently

Provide business-ready tables for reporting

Support historical tracking where required

Avoid repetitive logic for analysts and BI users

1.4 Non-Functional Requirements

Clear separation of concerns

Easy to understand data lineage

Reproducible transformations

Maintainable SQL logic

Scalable structure for future extensions

Transparent logic for learning and auditing purposes

2. Data Management Approach
2.1 Chosen Architecture: Medallion (Bronze / Silver / Gold)

A Medallion Architecture is used to organize data processing into clear layers:

Bronze → Raw ingestion

Silver → Cleaned and standardized data

Gold → Business-ready analytical models

This approach ensures:

Strong separation of concerns

Easier debugging

Clear ownership of transformations per layer

3. Layer Responsibilities
3.1 Bronze Layer — Raw Data

Purpose:

Preserve source data exactly as received

Characteristics:

No transformations

No business logic

Tables mirror source structure

Data loaded via batch processing

Full load or truncate & insert strategy

Why this matters:

Acts as a historical backup

Enables reprocessing if business logic changes

Improves data trust and auditability

3.2 Silver Layer — Cleaned & Standardized Data

Purpose:

Prepare data for analytical usage

Key responsibilities:

Data cleansing

Deduplication

Standardization of formats

Date corrections and alignment

Handling slowly changing data (where applicable)

Applying data quality rules

Important principle:

Every column is analyzed and validated individually.

Quality checks are not mixed into transformation scripts, but documented and validated separately to maintain clarity.

3.3 Gold Layer — Business-Ready Data

Purpose:

Serve data to end users

Characteristics:

Star schema modeling

Fact and dimension tables

Aggregations

Business metrics

Optimized for BI tools and ad-hoc SQL

Consumers:

BI dashboards

Analysts

Data science workloads

4. Data Refresh Strategy

Data does not require real-time updates

Daily refresh is sufficient

Some datasets may be refreshed at smaller intervals (e.g., every 4 hours)

This allows:

Use of materialized logic (e.g. CTAS)

Better performance

Reduced computational cost

5. Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

Clarity over cleverness

Explicit logic over hidden automation

Documentation over assumptions

The implementation intentionally shows:

Intermediate steps

Incremental improvements

Decision-making rationale

This makes the project suitable as:

A learning artifact

A portfolio reference

A proof of understanding, not just final results

6. Attribution & Learning Context

This project was built while following the
SQL Data Warehouse Project course by Baraa Khatib Salkini (Data With Baraa).

The structure and architectural principles are inspired by the course, while:

The implementation

Documentation

Walkthrough structure

Commentary and reasoning

are produced independently to demonstrate understanding and learning progress.
